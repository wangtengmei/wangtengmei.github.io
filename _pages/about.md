Personal Profile
======
Liu Huayu, from Changchun, Jilin.
I obtained a bachelor's and doctoral degree from the School of Computer Science, Jilin University from 2005 to 2013, under the guidance of Professor Jin Ying. After graduating with a doctoral degree in 2013, he stayed on campus to teach. In 2017, he was promoted to associate professor and obtained the qualification for doctoral enrollment from 2018 to 2019. In 2017, he was elected as a member of the Software Engineering Professional Committee of the Chinese Computer Society.
In terms of scientific research, data-driven approaches are taken as the core, targeting software communities and real-world problems. Technologies such as text analysis, data mining, code analysis, and deep learning are utilized to explore solutions. The research areas involved mainly include software engineering, human-computer interaction, data mining, and expert systems.
The main courses include Compilation Principles and Implementation, Software Engineering Tools and Applications, and Program Analysis Techniques. Responsible for and leading projects including the National Key R&D Program sub project, Jilin Province Youth Research Fund project, Jilin University Excellent Young Teacher Key Training Program, and Jilin University Excellent Youth Training Funding Program. Since 2017, I have published 20 SCI indexed papers, including 14 papers on IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, a well-known A-class publication recommended by CCF, and Information and Software Technology, Information Sciences, Journal of Systems and Software, Journal of Software: Evolution and Process, Software: Practice and Experience, IET Software, Science of Computer Programming, and Journal of Computer Science&Technology.
